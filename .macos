# macOS turdlet files

# Getting rid of .DS_Store turdlet files.  .DS_Store files is a file generated
# by macOS that contains custom attributes of its containing folder.
#
# Prevent .DS_Store file creation for SMB/CIFS, AFP, NFS, and WebDAV shares.

# Disable Spotlight 
#

# Spotlight is an indexing service that I never use.  After any major OS update, kernel panic,
# or abrupt shutdown it will re-index from scratch.  Normally, I'd let it be, but it has
# abused my mac too many times by running amok and hammering the CPU and disk.   

# Disable spotlight using launchctl.  This keeps the mds agent from getting launched:
sudo launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.metadata.mds.plist

# turn off Spotlight
sudo mdutil -a -i off

# Die. Die. Die.  Kill the indexer
killall mds > /dev/null 2>&1

# Stop indexing of ALL volumes:
sudo defaults write /.Spotlight-V100/VolumeConfiguration Exclusions -array "/Volumes"

# Delete spotlight index (this was a whopping 2G+ on my laptop.)
sudo rm -rf /.Spotlight-V100/*
